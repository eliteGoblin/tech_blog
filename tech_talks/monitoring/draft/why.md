We’re clearly moving into a new era of monitoring. I’ve heard that Netflix’s monitoring infrastructure costs a double-digit percentage of their entire budget. A few years ago this would have been shocking, but now we recognize the value of measuring. “If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it,” and making it possible for everyone to measure and analyze things is an enormous driver of IT speed and efficiency.


Metric resolution is critical to good monitoring. For effective monitoring it's important to collect the right information at the right frequency. Many traditional monitoring and metrics systems collect metrics at low resolution—for example, one data point every minute or even five minutes.

. InfluxDB is a time-series database that’s written in Go.

## Metric vs event log

ELK and Prometheus are fundamentally designed for different things. ELK is event logging, while Prometheus is metrics-based. You need both types of system. This talk explains more of the very high level differences: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCBGyLRJ1qo

*  Due to their lightweight structure and numeric nature, metrics lend themselves to many mathematical transformations including aggregation, correlations, distributions/histograms, and many others

*  The purpose of a log event is to convey the information about a particular action such as user login, or a critical incident such as a disk failure.

*  Log records are typically generated by your infrastructure or your applications. Logs are used to provide various operational teams as much specific detail as possible to help them analyze a particular operational or security incident.
*  As a result, the log data format tends can be longer. Logs are typically used for navigating down to the root cause after something happened, for this reason, they are valuable when performing forensic analysis.
*  Some logs are standardized; but often, their formats are at the freedom of developers to define them.
*  数据挖掘, tera bytes of logs
*  metrics are numbers, their compression rate is much higher than logs that represent text records; metrics can be stored, processed and retrieved at a fraction of a cost compared to logs (up to 10x)
*  Another important difference is that metrics are typically used to get a broad, system-level view across your entire application and cloud infrastructure. With centralized metrics and alerting, you can get an early indication of service level anomalous behavior which helps avoid customer facing issues
*  metric, event区别：系列文章3的对比图; metric在于异常检测，及早发现问题；log在于详尽的事后分析。(自己花一周的时间跟踪一个线程池bug)

感觉很好的解释:
*  logs as lists of discrete events, packaged and optimized for deep, drill-down analysis, while metrics are packaged to facilitate a continuous view of your environment (and how it’s changing overtime), and optimized for aggregate, numerical analysis.
*  You can analyze logs with tools such as Splunk or Loggly in the commercial space; the ELK stack or Graylog in the open-source spac
*  When it comes to metrics focused tools, you can use Wavefront in the commercial space, while legacy Graphite and OpenTSDB remain in the open source space
he multiple additions of 100 more metrics or even 1,000 more should not incur a huge jump in your processing costs, fill up your disc space quickly, or add significant delays in data processing and visualization
*  可以从log里derive metric,利用现有的log收集设施，The Wavefront platform gives you several ways to create metrics from logs, no matter your collection method is, e.g. if you use Splunk software, or the ELK stack or any other logging tool; you can even send logs using TCP
*  If have to wait for your tool to crunch the data until you come back from lunch, well you are not iterating quickly, as is required in continuous delivery mode
*  
Unified alerts and metrics can help react on the true glimpse of something wrong before it develops into the veritable “oh sh*t” type of trouble. Metrics help you detect and alert on unpredictable behavior change across everything even before customers are impacted…

*  仪表盘是metric, 黑盒子是log
*  给出典型log和metric，长什么样: 
    -  监控latency
    -  log很随意，很难systematically创建标准的log format来统一化监控
    -  log很可能被remove掉，coder并不知道监控依赖哪些log
*  gray log: really slow
